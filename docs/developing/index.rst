Developing RapidSMS
===================

RapidSMS is an `open source`_ project. That means you can get the source
code and change it to suit yourself. You can offer your changes back to
the project. You can help fix bugs, write new features, and even help
run the project.

This section of the documentation is about working on RapidSMS. There
are technical details, and some of the standards we follow for this
code.

See :ref:`rapidsms-community` for more about how our development
community works.
