The RapidSMS core team
======================

The RapidSMS team is fairly loosely organized. The ``core team`` is
basically anyone who has permission to merge into the official
repository.

The only real prerequisite to joining the core team is showing that
you'd be a useful member of the team.  So, start by
:ref:`contributing <joining>`. After you've done this for a while,
someone on the core team might decide to give you access. If not,
feel free to ask on the ``rapidsms-dev`` list, where by this time
you should be well known anyway.

You can view the current core team on the
`RapidSMS GitHub project page`_.

There are some distinguished roles on the team. Note that any
person can play multiple roles.

Core Dev
........

A core dev is a community member who has commit rights to the
GitHub repository. They've usually been active for some time,
have a track record of submitting quality pull requests and
help review outstanding PRs.

.. _release-manager:

Release Manager
...............

A release manager is a member of the core dev team who performs
each release when feature development is complete. They
collaborate with the :ref:`release-champion` on the
:ref:`release-process`,
provide final QA before each release, and actually perform
the final :ref:`release process steps <release-checklist>`
to publish the new release.

Community Coordinator
.....................

A community coordinator is a core dev who helps organize the
core team to identify future milestones and releases. They are
active on the mailing lists and help identify release champions
for each new version.

.. _release-champion:

Release Champion
................

A release champion is a core dev who is excited about the
upcoming release, has expertise in the topic and wants to
lead development of the proposed features. They will organize
tickets, delegate tasks to other willing core devs and perform
actual development themselves. Their job is expanded on in
the :ref:`release-process`.
