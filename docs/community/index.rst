The RapidSMS Community
======================

The RapidSMS community is everyone who helps make RapidSMS what it is.

This section of the documentation is about the RapidSMS community,
and how it works.

See :ref:`developing-rapidsms` for technical information about
making changes to RapidSMS.

When working with the RapidSMS community, it'll help to remember a few
things:

* At the other end of each email address is another person.
* Most of the people in the community contribute because they want
  to help, not because it's their job.

So - be polite, give each other the benefit of the doubt, and try to
communicate clearly but be ready to try another approach if your
point doesn't seem to be getting across.
