Joining the RapidSMS community
==============================

We're always excited to welcome new volunteers to the RapidSMS project. As it
keeps growing, we need more people to help others and contribute back to the
community. As soon as you learn RapidSMS, you can contribute in many ways:

* Join the `rapidsms`_ mailing list and answer questions. This users list, the
  primary RapidSMS mailing list, is used to ask and answer questions, help work
  through bugs, and discuss general RapidSMS topics.

* Join the `rapidsms-dev`_ mailing list. This list is used to discuss RapidSMS
  core and active country projects. This ranges from new RapidSMS features
  to large scale RapidSMS deployments in Zambia. If you're interested in any of
  this, please join the conversation!

* Join the `#rapidsms IRC channel`_ on Freenode and answer questions. By
  explaining RapidSMS to other users, you're going to learn a lot about the
  framework yourself. You can use the `webchat`_ client for this too.

And, of course, you can help out by working *on* RapidSMS.

* Report bugs in our `ticket tracker`_.

* Follow our :ref:`coding-standards`.

* Open :ref:`pull requests <pullrequest>` for features and bug fixes against
  the `develop` branch.  We use the `Gitflow`_ model for our development.
  See :ref:`submitting` for more on this.

* Comment on open issues and pull requests. Try the changes yourself and
  report on how well they work in the issue or pull request.  See
  :ref:`reviewing` for more on this.

* Try the ``develop`` branch and report any problems, especially if recent
  changes break your own application.

* Improve the RapidSMS :ref:`documentation <writing-documentation>` (what
  you're reading now!).

* Participate on the `rapidsms-dev`_ mailing list.
