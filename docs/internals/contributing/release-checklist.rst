RapidSMS Release Checklist
==========================
This is a checklist for releasing a new version of RapidSMS.

This is intended for someone who has been designated the release manager,
the person responsible for making an official release of RapidSMS.

For a higher-level overview of the whole release cycle, see the
:doc:`Release Process </internals/contributing/release-process>`.

Git branches
------------

RapidSMS uses the
`Git Flow <http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>`_
process for development. The two branches of concern at release time are:

* **master** - always has the most recently released code. Each release is
  tagged ``vX.X.X``.
* **develop** - contains the code under development for the next release

So technically, what makes a new release is merging ``develop`` to ``master``
and tagging it.  Of course, we don't want to do that until we're ready.

Required permissions
--------------------

You'll need the following authorizations to make a release:

Github
    push to the `rapidsms repository <https://github.com/rapidsms/rapidsms>`_
PyPI
    push updates to the `rapidsms package <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RapidSMS>`_
Read the Docs
    change the configuration for RapidSMS

If you need any of these authorizations:

* create any of the accounts you don't have
* send an email to rapidsms-dev@googlegroups.com and ask for someone to give
  you the needed authorizations. Be sure to include your userid for each
  account.

Release checks
--------------

All the following checks should be verified before continuing:

* ``master`` merged to ``develop`` to be sure any hotfixes are included
* Version number in ``rapidsms/__init__.py`` updated
* `Next` version number in ``rapidsms/docs/conf.py`` updated
* New release labeled as current in ``rapidsms/docs/releases`` in
  ``index.rst``, ``this-release.rst``, and ``roadmap.rst``
* All git issues for this release's milestone have been resolved.  (closed or
  moved to another milestone)
* All tests pass against the ``develop`` branch.  Look for a passing build
  on `Travis <https://travis-ci.org/rapidsms/rapidsms/>`_ of the tip commit
  on the ``develop`` branch.
* A distribution tarball can be built with ``python setup.py sdist``, it can
  be installed with pip, has the right version, and works when installed.
  (SUGGEST HOW TO TEST AN INSTALLED RAPIDSMS)

Release steps
-------------

Take these steps to release the new version:

* Make a fresh clone of the repo:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone git@github.com:rapidsms/rapidsms.git
    cd rapidsms

* Checkout master:

.. code-block:: bash

    git checkout master

* Merge develop into master:

.. code-block:: bash

    git merge develop

* Run the tests locally. (This assumes you have tox on your path. Create a
  new virtualenv and install it if needed.) The tests must pass before
  proceeding.

.. code-block:: bash

    tox

* Create a new tag:

.. code-block:: bash

    git tag -a vX.X.X

* Push the merged master branch and tag to github:

.. code-block:: bash

    git push origin master --tags

* While Travis is testing the pushed branch, compose a release announcement.

Here's a template that can be used for release announcements. You can copy
the summary from the release notes:

    Subject: RapidSMS X.X.X Released

    I'm excited to announce the release of
    `RapidSMS X.X.X <https://rapidsms.readthedocs.org/en/vX.X.X/releases/X.X.X.html>`_!
    Here's a quick summary:

    * **Major change or feature 1:** *one-line explanation*
    * **Major change or feature 2:** *one-line explanation*
    * ...

    You can find the full list of changes and upgrade guide in the
    `RapidSMS X.X.X Release Notes <https://rapidsms.readthedocs.org/en/vX.X.X/releases/X.X.X.html>`_.

    I'd like to give special thanks to Tom, Dick, and Harry for their work
    on this release. *[EXPAND ON THAT].*

    More help is always welcome. If you're interested, you can read the
    `contributing guide <http://rapidsms.readthedocs.org/en/vX.X.X/internals/contributing/index.html>`_.

    The next release will be *Y.Y.Y* and will focus on *FILL IN MAJOR GOALS
    FOR Y.Y.Y.*

    As always, if you have any questions or issues, please feel free to
    post them to this list or ask in the #rapidsms IRC channel on
    `Freenode <http://freenode.net/>`_. Bugs can be reported on
    `Github <https://github.com/rapidsms/rapidsms>`_.

* Verify that Travis tests have passed for the pushed master

* Push the new version to `PyPI <http://docs.python.org/3/distutils/packageindex.html>`_:

  .. code-block:: bash

        python setup.py sdist upload

* Add the new version to the tags that Read the Docs should build

* Email the release announcement to rapidsms@googlegroups.com and
  rapidsms-dev@googlegroups.com

Start Next Release
------------------

Back on the ``develop`` branch, we can now start on the next release:

* Merge ``master`` to ``develop`` to make sure we're starting from the same
  code that's currently released (there might have been merge conflicts or
  something during the release process)
* Update the version in ``rapidsms/__init__.py`` and the next version in
  ``rapidsms/docs/conf.py``
* Start a new releasenotes document in ``rapidsms/docs/release``. Use the
  previous release's document as a template. Be sure
  to label it at the top as under development.
* Update ``rapidsms/docs/release/index.rst`` to mark the next release as
  under development.

Now we can start merging features intended for the next release. Review
`Git Flow <http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>`_
for more about how to use git branches while developing.
