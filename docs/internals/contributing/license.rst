Contributor Licence Agreements (CLAs)
-------------------------------------

The license agreement is a legal document in which you state you are entitled
to contribute the code/documentation/translation to RapidSMS and are willing to
have it used in distributions and derivative works. This means that should
there be any kind of legal issue in the future as to the origins and ownership
of any particular piece of code, UNICEF has the necessary forms on file from
the contributor(s) saying they were permitted to make this contribution.

This is a pure license agreement, not a copyright assignment. You still
maintain the full copyright for your contributions. You are only providing a
license to UNICEF to distribute your code without further restrictions. This is
not the case for all CLA's, but it is the case for the one we are using.
