RapidSMS 1.0 Roadmap
====================

This document describes the high level goals and schedule for releasing RapidSMS 1.0. It was originally created by Colin Copeland and Tobias McNulty in collaboration with UNICEF Innovation. However, the document is open to the greater RapidSMS community for discussion, comments, and other feedback.

Design Philosophies
-------------------

* **Encourage community involvement.** New and long term RapidSMS users should feel welcomed in the community. Introductory materials, such as tutorials and how-to documentation, should be written to help beginners. Standards and design patters should be in place to make the development environment more consistent.
* **Be more Django-like.** RapidSMS is, for the most part, a set of Django applications with a message processing component. RapidSMS should be packaged like every other Django app and follow the communities best practices.
* **Improve test coverage.** Every good Python package should provide a robust test suite for coverage and regression testing. New core code should always include tests before being merged into master.
* **Write better documentation.** The RapidSMS project should provide consistent and readable documentation. The documentation should be written in a maintainable format (ReST) and we should aim to improve it as often as possible.
* **Batteries included.** The bar needs to be raised for the contrib applications. RapidSMS should provide you with enough tools out of the box to hit the ground running.
* **Guidelines for maintenance and scaling.** Deployment examples and best practices should be provided to ease the transition to hosted environments.
