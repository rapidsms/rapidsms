.. RapidSMS documentation master file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on Sun Oct 16 13:48:46 2011.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

RapidSMS Documentation
=======================

.. This toctree is not displayed, but it controls the navigation order
   through the documentation (next/previous etc).

.. It MUST therefore be kept in the same order as the displayed contents
   below, or it will be very confusing.
   Some of these are links to pages that have their own .toctree's,
   which will be worked into the overall navigation correctly by
   Sphinx, so we don't need to include all the subpages here.
