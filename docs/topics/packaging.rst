Packaging your RapidSMS application for re-use
==============================================

If you'd like others to be able to use your application, you'll want to
package it and publish it on `PyPI`_.

You will package and publish your RapidSMS application in the same way you
would any other Django application. Django provides excellent documentation
on `packaging your Django app`_, so we won't try to write the same thing
here.
