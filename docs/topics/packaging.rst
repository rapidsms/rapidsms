Packaging your RapidSMS application for re-use
==============================================

If you'd like others to be able to use your application, you'll want to
package it and publish it on `PyPI`_.

You will package and publish your RapidSMS application in the same way you
would any other Django application. Django provides excellent documentation
on `packaging your Django app`_, so we won't try to write the same thing
here.

We recommend using at least the following classifiers on your package::

    Framework :: Django
    Intended Audience :: Developers
    Programming Language :: Python
    Topic :: Communications
    Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries :: Python Modules

Depending on your project, also consider::

    Operating System :: OS Independent
    Topic :: Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content
    Environment :: Web Environment

You'll also need to give your package a license that allows others to
use it. RapidSMS uses the `BSD license`_ and we recommend it if you don't
have a strong preference for another license.
