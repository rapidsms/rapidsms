Deploying your Application
==========================

*RapidSMS can easily be deployed in many ways*.
Deployment is a large topic, contains many right answers and is largely
dependent on your application requirements. Our goal is not to provide the
best solution or a configuration that will work on any application. We only
want to provide you with the proper resources to make the best decisions.

Typical Deployment Steps
........................

In order to deploy, you need to accomplish a number of things.

Initially:

* Establish a virtual environment
* Install Python dependencies
* Install project code
* Establish settings specific for that server (secret keys, passwords,
  location of database, etc.)
* Sync database
* Collect static files
* Start processes (web server, workers, etc)

On each deploy:

* Update Python dependencies
* Update project code
* Apply migrations to database
* Collect static files
* Restart processes

You might also want to:

* Backup or download the database
* Restore or upload the database
* Backup/restore user-uploaded files

Different environments
......................

The options for accomplishing these things depend in part on the
server environment.

Non-PaaS
--------

The `Django documentation`_ and the Deploying Django chapter of the
`Django book`_ provide some advice about how to run
a Django application like RapidSMS in production.

One approach you'll often see when deploying to your own hardware or
to a virtual machine is using `Fabric`_ to implement deploy
commands that a developer can use. A developer might type
``fab staging deploy`` to update the code on the staging server, or
``fab production setup_server`` to provision the production server.
To help you write these commands, Fabric provides a library of methods
for running commands on your remote server, uploading files, etc.

PaaS
----

If you're using a PaaS, your provider takes care of setting up your
application on their servers, and will provide tools and documentation
about how to deploy your application.

Examples

The RapidSMS wiki has a

with links to examples of how people provision and deploy RapidSMS applications.
