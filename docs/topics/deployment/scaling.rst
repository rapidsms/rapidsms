Scaling
=======

If your application is successful, you might find that your single
server cannot keep up anymore. Responses might become slow, or
operations might just not complete.

There are many steps you can take to scale up your implementation
so that it can handle more traffic.

Rather than going into any more detail here, we'd like to direct
you to the `Scaling section`_ of the Deployment chapter of the
Django Book, which you can read online. This section walks you
step-by-step through the changes you can make as your traffic
grows in order to keep up.
