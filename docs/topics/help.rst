Getting help
============

If you need help while using RapidSMS, there are several ways you
can get it.


* Ask on the `#rapidsms IRC channel`_ on Freenode. You can use the
  `webchat`_ client for this too.  The #rapidsms IRC channel, like most
  IRC channels, is pretty informal. You don't need to ask whether it's
  okay to ask a question - just ask it.

* Ask on the `rapidsms`_ mailing list. This list is used to ask and answer
  questions, help work through bugs, and discuss general RapidSMS topics.

  Note that there's a second mailing list, ``rapidsms-dev``. You're welcome
  to join both, but ``rapidsms-dev`` is intended for discussing development
  of RapidSMS itself (changing the RapidSMS code), while ``rapidsms``
  is to talk about using RapidSMS, writing apps that use RapidSMS, etc.
