Installing RapidSMS
===================

.. note::
    RapidSMS depends on the Django_ web framework. If you're new to Django, we
    recommend reading through the `Django installation instructions`_ before
    installing RapidSMS.

The recommended way to install RapidSMS is with Pip_ (since it's available on
PyPI_)::

    pip install rapidsms
