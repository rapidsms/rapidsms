Backwards-incompatible changes in RapidSMS 0.14.0
=================================================

* All views built-in to RapidSMS, including contrib apps, now require
  login.

* Removed `bin/rapidsms-admin.py`. It relied on the RapidSMS `startproject`
  management command which had already been removed. For the recommended way
  to start a new RapidSMS project, see
  :ref:`installing-rapidsms-project-template`.
