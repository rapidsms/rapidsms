=============================

Welcome to RapidSMS 0.14.0! These release notes cover the new features in 0.14.0
as well as some :ref:`backwards-incompatible-changes-0.14.0` you'll want to be
aware of when upgrading from RapidSMS 0.13.0.

What's New
==========

 * :setting:`RAPIDSMS_HANDLERS` is a simpler way to control which handlers
   are loaded. :setting:`INSTALLED_HANDLERS`, :setting:`EXCLUDED_HANDLERS`,
   and :setting:`RAPIDSMS_HANDLERS_EXCLUDE_APPS` are deprecated. For more
   information see :ref:`handlers-discovery`.

 .. _backwards-incompatible-changes-0.14.0:

Backwards-incompatible changes in RapidSMS 0.14.0
=================================================

* All views built-in to RapidSMS, including contrib apps, now require
  login.

* Removed `bin/rapidsms-admin.py`. It relied on the RapidSMS `startproject`
  management command which had already been removed. For the recommended way
  to start a new RapidSMS project, see
  :ref:`installing-rapidsms-project-template`.
