Backwards-incompatible changes in RapidSMS 0.16.0
=================================================

* Style files removed from base: icons.css, modules.css, splits.css, and
  tables.css. These are no longer used in the new bootstrap-based pages, so
  they've been removed from the RapidSMS base style files and are no longer
  loaded from the base template.

  The old ``locations`` contrib app does still use them, so they've been moved
  into that app and that app's base template changed to load them from there.

  If you have an app that's still using any of these styles, and aren't ready
  to convert your app to the new, bootstrap-based look, it's probably simplest
  for you to copy them from ``locations`` into your app and load them from
  your app's base template.
