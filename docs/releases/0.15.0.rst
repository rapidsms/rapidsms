RapidSMS 0.15.0 release notes (next release)
============================================

Welcome to RapidSMS 0.15.0! These release notes cover the new features in 0.15.0
as well as some :ref:`backwards-incompatible-changes-0.15.0` you'll want to be
aware of when upgrading from RapidSMS 0.14.0.

What's New
==========

 * :setting:`RAPIDSMS_HANDLERS` is a simpler way to control which handlers
   are loaded. :setting:`INSTALLED_HANDLERS`, :setting:`EXCLUDED_HANDLERS`,
   and :setting:`RAPIDSMS_HANDLERS_EXCLUDE_APPS` are deprecated. For more
   information see :ref:`handlers-discovery`.
 * If there are any errors that would prevent the router, apps, or handlers
   from being initialized, they will result in an ImproperlyConfigured
   exception occurring during startup, causing startup to fail. Previously,
   this kind of error might not be discovered until the first request was
   processed, and perhaps not even then unless you looked at the logs.
