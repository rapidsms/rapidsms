# standard django-admin.py -- but if we're creating a project, we are
# going to... (wait for it...) monkeypatch our command into sys.modules,
# and trick django into calling it instead of its own! hahaha!
#
# ...but seriously, django provides no way of doing this via management
# commands, since we're spawning a new project here, and django doesn't
# know to look in the rapidsms package for commands yet.
